        <h1>Bohemian Rhapsody</h1>
        <h3><em>by Oueen</em></h3>
        <p>
            Is this the real life?<br>
            Is this just fantasy?<br>
            Caught in a landslide<br>
            No escape from reality<br>
            Open your eyes<br>
            Look up to the skies and see<br>
            I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
            Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
            A little high, little low<br>
            Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me<br>
            Mama, just killed a man<br>
            Put a gun against his head<br>
            Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
            Mama, life had just begun<br>
            But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
            Mama, ooo<br>
            Didn't mean to make you cry<br>
            If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
            Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br>
            Too late, my time has come<br>
            Sends shivers down my spine<br>
            Body's aching all the time<br>
            Goodbye everybody - I've got to go<br>
            Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth<br>
            Mama, ooo - (anyway the wind blows)<br>
            I don't want to die<br>
            I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all<br>
            I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
            Scaramouch, scaramouch will you do the fandango<br>
            Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me<br>
            Gallileo, Gallileo,<br>
            Gallileo, Gallileo,<br>
            Gallileo Figaro - magnifico<br>
            But I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me<br>
            He's just a poor boy from a poor family<br>
            Spare him his life from this monstrosity<br>
            Easy come easy go - will you let me go<br>
            Bismillah! No - we will not let you go - let him go<br>
            Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go<br>
            Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go<br>
            Will not let you go - let me go (never)<br>
            Never let you go - let me go<br>
            Never let me go - ooo<br>
            No, no, no, no, no, no, no -<br>
            Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go<br>
            Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me<br>
            For me<br>
            For me<br>
            So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye<br>
            So you think you can love me and leave me to die<br>
            Oh baby - can't do this to me baby<br>
            Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here<br>
            Ooh yeah, ooh yeah<br>
            Nothing really matters<br>
            Anyone can see<br>
            Nothing really matters - nothing really matters to me<br>
            Anyway the wind blows...<br>
